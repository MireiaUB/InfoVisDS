## Reusable charts

Reusable charts allow you to re-use the same code for all your charts only changing the settings and the data.

Mike Bostock set the fundamentals in his post:
[Towards reusable Charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/)

And you may find many examples on GitHub.

In this GitHub branch I will be posting some reusable charts along the course. Now, there is only a bar chart.

### Single Bar chart

There are three files for the single bar chart:

- singleBarChart.js
with all the javascript necessary to build a bar chart
- singleBarChart.css
with a list of CSS properties to customize the bar chart appearance. This file is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
- singleBarChart.html
showing how to use the previous two files.  In this file you can choose also several data files and several sizes for the chart, in order to see how it reacts at changing data and size.

You also have three demo data files:
- data1.csv
- data2.csv
- data3.csv
