## Reusable charts

Reusable charts allow you to re-use the same code for all your charts only changing the settings and the data.

Mike Bostock set the fundamentals in his post:
[Towards reusable Charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/)

And you may find many examples on GitHub.

In this GitHub branch I've posted examples of basic charts such as barChart,lineChart,scatterPlot and donutChart. Lately I've added Waffle chart, very useful for infographies
