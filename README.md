## Layout

In order to be able to combine several charts in one screen, you need to create a box for each and lay them out on the screen.

### CSS Grid

This is the easiest function and it is very powerful. It is based on CSS properties and defines a grid of columns and rows in the pages.

To start with it, I recommend:

- [Complete guide to CSS grids](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- [Grids by example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/)
 
You have also a very simple example in this github to play around:

- [CSS grid example](CSSGrid.html)

### Bootstrap

If you want to create a complete website and profit from many widgets and patterns, you can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the most widely used frontend framework.

This is not a so easy solution, and it may take some time to get the hack of it, but it is worth trying it now or later.

Bootstrap website if thoroughly documented and you'll find many good online tutorials.
